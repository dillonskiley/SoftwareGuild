                      <p>Hello, my name is <strong>Dillon Kiley</strong>. I was born in 1998 in <strong>Tobolsk, Russia</strong>. I was adopted at the age of 1 to an American family in <strong>Denver, Colorado.</strong></p>
                      <p>I've lived in Denver ever since I came here in 1999. Then two years later my parents adopted another kid from Russia and named him Dane. <span style="background-color: rebeccapurple; border: thin solid darkblue;">Then 2 years after Dane's</span> adoption, my parents adopted a little girl from China and named her Isabel.</p>

                        <p>I've been playing soccer since the age of 5. I grew up playing recreational thought the city's youth league. In middle school I decided to play club soccer for the Rapids Acadmeny. I worked my way up to the highest level though the years and got offered a few schollarships to play in college.  </p>
                        <p>Instead of playing in college, I decided to take an offer to play professional indoor soccer. </p>
