/*
An array in JavaScript can be declared in a couple ways.
    - use square brackets ([]), separating each element (member) of the array with a comma (,).
    - Array object

    Index:   0      1      2        etc...
    Element: Aneki  Quell  Clarity  etc...

Ex:
*/
var friends = ["Aneki", "Quell", "Clarity", "Sleepy", "Roghar", "DM Crimson"];

/*
friends.length;
    - If we want to see how many friends we have in the friends array, we could look at its length property in the console:
*/
/*
friends[0];
Output: 
"Aneki"
