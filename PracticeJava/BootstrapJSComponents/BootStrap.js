Bootstrap is mostly CSS. CSS is amazing these days, so Bootstrap can do almost everything it wants to do with CSS. However, CSS can't do everything. That's where JavaScript comes in. Bootstrap uses just a bit of JavaScript to power a few of its advanced components.

Examples include:

    Carousel

    Modal

    Popovers

    Scrollspy

    Tooltips

Data Attributes
    -  Data attributes are non-standard HTML attributes that are still syntactically valid. They're used to store data that's meaningful to third-party tools like Bootstrap. Below, the data-toggle attribute tells Bootstrap that the <button> contains a tooltip and data-placement tells it to place the tooltip above the button.

    <button class="btn btn-primary" title="Click this button to place your order." type="button" 
        data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top">
    Place My Order
    </button>
