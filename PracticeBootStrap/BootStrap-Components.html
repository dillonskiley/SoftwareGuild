<!-- Bootstrap Components-->

<!--
    Bootstrap allows us to keep a consistent look and feel throughout our website. One of the ways it does that is by providing components that have a similar look and feel. In this lesson, we will look at some of the components included in Bootstrap.

<!-- Icons
        There are multiple options for a monochromatic font of icons and symbols in Bootstrap, which can be used to quickly label places of a particular functionality. The specific font of Octicons has been tested with Bootstrap. Some uses for these could include:

        Using the house icon as a link to your homepage on a responsive site
        Using the icons for bold, italics, and alignment in building a text editor
        Using some of the currency icons – including euro (€), dollar ($), and pound(£)

    For more about the Octicons fonts, check out Octicons's official GitHub site.

    More details on the Icon options available in Bootstrap can be found in Bootstrap's page on Icons (Links to an external site.).

<!-- Form Components
    Bootstrap comes with a variety of form components so that you can apply a consistent look and feel for the forms across your site, from the Contact form to the Comments section! Bootstrap’s form components include:

    Dropdowns and button dropdowns
    Buttons and button groups – from shortcuts to filter content in a table to shortcuts to font sizes
    Input groups – add text or buttons to attach to any text-based input before and/or after the <input /> control
-->

<!-- Formatting Components
    Sometimes, you may find yourself needing to call attention to a particular section of a page. Bootstrap has components specifically designed for this, including:

    Jumbotron – flexible way of showcasing content.

    Badges – used for showing a variety of things – including unread messages, new messages, or missed contact requests. 

    Page Header – including support for a subheader.

<!-- Navigation Components
    A key to a user-friendly site is to have navigation that is both easy to follow and visually appealing. Bootstrap allows us to achieve that with:

    Tabs for navigation
    Pills for navigation
    Classes for building complex navigation bars
    Breadcrumbs
