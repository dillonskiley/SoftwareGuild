<!-- Bootstrap and CSS -->

<!-- Typography

    Bootstrap overrides the browser's default typography for common elements such as:

    Headings – <h1> to <h6>
    Body copy – any text
    In-line text elements – including bold (<strong>), italicized (<em>), and deleted (<del>) text
    Lists – including ordered and unordered lists

    You can gain even more control by using Bootstrap's explicit typography styles. These include:

    Classes for text alignment, wrapping, and effects (Links to an external site.)
    Stand-out display headings: 
      <h1 class="display-1">Important Heading</h1>
    Blockquotes
    Emphasized paragraphs: 
      <p class="lead">This paragraph is more important than the others!</p>
-->

<!-- Tables
    Table formatting using normal CSS can be troublesome, especially because there are nested elements and trying to figure out where to apply the styles can take a bit of detective work. Thankfully, Bootstrap’s table styling is applied in sensible spots, including:

    Styling for hovering over rows or alternating striped applied to <table>
    Borders, lines, and condensed lines applied to <table>
    Contextual classes – adding color with meaning to <tr> or <td> elements

    Bootstrap also supports responsive tables. Wrap your <table> in a parent bearing the .table-responsive class and your table will become scrollable if it out-grows the space available in the view.

<!-- Forms
    Forms include inputs, labels, and buttons, but there's more to style than just those. Bootstrap scales form content based on the view width. In addition to HTML controls, Bootstrap offers styles for the following form features:

    Control state: 
        -Focused
        -Disabled 
        -Read-only 
        -Valid or Invalid
    
    Explicit control sizes
    Help text (instructions or hints)
-->

<!-- Images
    Image handling is easier with Bootstrap:

    Make images responsive by adding the .img-fluid class. With it, images scale nicely within their parent.
    Add a gently rounded border with .img-thumbnail.
    Add a more pronounced shape effect with the .rounded or .rounded-circle classes.

<!-- Utilities
    Say you want to tweak some HTML that doesn't quite fit into typography, tables, forms, or images. That's no problem. Mix and match Bootstraps utility classes to get exactly the effect you're after. Utilities include:

    Borders (Links to an external site.)
    Colors (Links to an external site.)
    Flex and float layouts
    Position (Links to an external site.)
    Sizes (Links to an external site.)
    And many more
