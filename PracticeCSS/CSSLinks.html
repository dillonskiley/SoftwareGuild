<!--
    In order to style them effectively, the link's pseudo-classes should be styled in this order:

    link – unvisited link
    visited – visited link (meaning that you have recently opened the target page in your browser)
    hover – mouse over the link
    active – selected link

    In this example, our requirements are:
    Unvisited links are green.
    Visited links are red.
    All links are underlined, except when hovering over a link.
    All links are in a monospace font, except when hovering over a link. When hovering over the link, the text is in cursive.
    We want to make sure it is clear which link we are selecting. Active (selected) links are bold.

    a {
  font-family: monospace;
  text-decoration: underline;
  font-weight: none;
}

a:link {
  color: green;
}

a:visited {
  color: red;
}

a:hover {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: #00c;
  font-family: cursive;
}

a:active {
  font-weight: bold;
}
