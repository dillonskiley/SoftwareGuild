<!-- Fonts -->
<!-- A font includes the size, weight, and style of a typeface. A typeface is the collection of glyphs used in the text. CSS will allow us to style our text with different font styles, weights, sizes, and families.

<!-- Style 
    font-style
    
    italic – italicized font
    oblique – slanted font
    normal – default font style, no slanting

<!-- Size

    Absolute – xx-small, x-small, small, medium, large, x-large, xx-large
    Length – em, ex, px, cm, mm, in, pt, or pc
    Percentage – %
    Relative – smaller, larger

    For em and en
    - Units em and en are relative values that refer to the default width of the letter M or the letter N (respectively) in the current font set. As an example, 1em is the default size of the selected font, while 1.5em is 150% larger than the default.

-->

<!-- Family 
    font-family
    The family of a font is the category to which the font belongs.

    Generic Families:
        serif – normal fonts with serifs (small lines often added at the end of the lines that make up the letter) such as Garamond, Georgia, New York, Times, and Times New Roman
    
        sans-serif – normal fonts without serifs such as Arial, Geneva, Helvetica, Lucida Sans, Trebuchet, and Verdana
        
        monospace – fixed-width fonts such as Courier, Consolas, Lucida Console, and Monaco
    
        cursive – fonts that emulate handwriting such as Comic Sans MS, Lucida Handwriting, and Zapf Chancery
    
        fantasy – decorative fonts such as Copperplate, Desdemona, Impact, and Kino

        Ex. 
        font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';

        You could use the following stack, which tells the browser to use Comic Sans MS if it is available on the user's computer; otherwise, it will use Arial.
        Ex. 
        font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', arial;
